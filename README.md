# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description
The goal of this project was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Working with Express.js API and configuring it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Key Points
1. User can connect to a database using Sequelize, after entering db name, username, and password.
2. When entering schema and seed commands, the development database is created and seeded with test data.
3. When the application is started, the server is started and the sequelize models are synced to the MYSQL database.
4. API GET routes for categories, products, and tags display information in a json format when accessed.
5. Using API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core updates the information in thed database.
